          Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
        </h3>
        <h4>
          Certain visitors to 7 Duck Studios’s websites choose to interact with 7 Duck Studios in ways that require 7 Duck Studios to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that 7 Duck Studios gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, visitors who choose to contact us must provide their name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with 7 Duck Studios – full app or in-app-purchases for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, 7 Duck Studios collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with 7 Duck Studios. 7 Duck Studios does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website or product-related activities.

Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, 7 Duck Studios discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when 7 Duck Studios believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of 7 Duck Studios, third parties or the public at large.
